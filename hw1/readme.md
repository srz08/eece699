## Deliverables

 - The documentation is included in the .ipynb file in length 
    and includes everything that was asked. This was done for the
    comments to be clear and in order with the proceedings of the
    code.
 - The comments and the testing instances are showcased clearly
    in the notebook too.

## Opening the file

- The available code is submitted in python format which can
    be run in any IDE. It is also submitted in .ipynb which can 
    be opening in Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab.
- To run, we must have the IMDB.csv file which is the dataset, 
    the model and vectorizer submitted as pickle files.
- The path of the documents need to be changed, in order to 
    run everything from scratch.
- The notebook is available in this link:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19GL7W7dgzdzjmlftxWLRVfCDVBL8V2p5?usp=sharing
This is shared for immediate access and view of the assignment. Else, visual studio supports the .ipynb format for the document attached.
- The machine learning model is saved as a pickle file in the lab folder.
