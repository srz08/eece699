        "We will start by a quick reminder of the definitions of RL and GA. RL is a training process for Machine Learning models to eventually take decisions , by utilizing an agent, in an environment, using a reward system. GA is a search \"metaheuristic\" that is based on a selection process that selects the fittest data samples and reporduces based on these samples. We can see from the defintions the difference is obvious, where in RL there is non-stop learning from the agent whereas GA some agents have to die in order for the others to learn. In addition, RL is more specific for problems in which we can find some policy and a reward system related to the policy. However, GA can be applied to any optimization problem as we can find a fitness function to characterize the problem and change the solution accordingly. Each also has is drawbacks, where we know that in GA, finding and coding of the fitness function and other functions related to GA can be challenging and it is expensive when it comes to the amount of computation done, and for RL, we need a lot of data, it is less efficient for real life problems and simple problems and is computationally heavy. This means that RL is suitable for some problems, while GA is more suitable for others. Also, there has been some instances of both being used simultaneously.\n",
        "In the proposed solution, we have defined the GA solution using the selection, the creation of new population, the fitness function and the remaining functions. An RL solution would conceptually include the definition of he environment, the possible actions (going left or right), the states that we could get to that will be mapped to actions learned by the algorithm based on a reward system we also define. The reward system could be +0 for all actions, except the fall -10 for example, or +5 for every successful move and -10 for the fall, or any system that would make sense and that will get use to our wanted solution."
