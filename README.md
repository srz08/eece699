# Description

These homeworks are part of the Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence course I took as part of my undergraduate at the American University of Beirut. 
- The first homework utilizes the SHAP library to explain the output of a classifier NLP model that predicts the sentiment in IMDB reviews. More description can be seen inside the hw1 folder.
- The second homework is a solution for the Cartpole problem using a genetic algorithm. Cartpole - known also as an Inverted Pendulum is a pendulum with a center of gravity above its pivot point. Itâ€™s unstable, but can be controlled by moving the pivot point under the center of mass. The goal is to keep the cartpole balanced by applying appropriate forces to a pivot point.
